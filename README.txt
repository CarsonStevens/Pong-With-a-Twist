This project is is a fully functional recreation of Pong, but with a twist! The ball bounces back and forth, but once it hits the oponents side, it bounces off, and another paddle is added or moved. This project implements buttons interactivity with the arrow keys moving the paddle. There are also features that are added to make it a bit better, such as a pause button, score and life counter, and an option to even pick your ball and paddle color. This project relies heavily on JavaScript for its functionality, and based on the previously discussed points, we believe it deserves 100 points.
